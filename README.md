# LandProtect
Claim land in Minecraft and protect it with this simple yet powerful plugin written in JavaScript using ScriptCraft.

#How to claim land
Place a sing and type a name between two ^ signs. Like this: ^my House Name^
You can use spaces and use more than 1 line.
From that very first moment, your land will be yours and no one else will be able to break any block, open any chest or grief in anyway without your permission.

#How to abandon land
Place a sing and type ^abandon^ inside your claimed land.
The land will be free again.

#How to rename your land name
Place again a sign inside your claimed land and type another name, like this: ^New House Name^

#How to add players to your land+
You can also share your land with other players.
Add player to your chunk doing: /chunkadd <player name> while standing inside the chunk you want to share.
You can delete his permission anytime with: /chuckkick <player name>

#More info & easy installation
LandProtect uses ScriptCraft, a lightweight Minecraft plugin that works as a bridge for JavaScript to use the full Bukkit API.
ScriptCraft plugins don't need to be compiled to .jar to work, leting you easily edit the code and improve it directly, making things more Open Source friendly.

Download ScriptCraft from here: www.scriptcraftjs.org, ScriptCraft will generate its own folder where you can add your custom plugins, like LandProtect.
Inside the ScriptCraft folder, go to 'plugins' and paste the landprotection.js file inside.
Happy hacking!
